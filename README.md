# Insights

## Task 1:

### KPIs to Measure Customer Retention:

**Churn Rate:**
The percentage of customers who stopped using the company's product or service during a specific period.

**Customer Satisfaction:** 
Measured through surveys, feedback, and reviews.

**Calls Answered/Abandoned:** 
The number of calls answered versus the number abandoned.

**Calls by Time:** Distribution of calls over different time periods (e.g., peak hours, off-peak hours).

**Average Speed of Answer:** The average time it takes for calls to be answered.

**Agent's Performance Quadrant:** A comparison of an agent's performance based on the average handle time (talk duration) and calls answered.

### Creating a Dashboard:

The dashboard should include visual representations of these KPIs, such as charts, graphs, and tables, to facilitate easy understanding and decision-making. The dashboard should be customizable, allowing the user to filter data based on different criteria (e.g., time period, agent, customer segment).

## Task 2:

### Insights from Diversity and Inclusion Data:

**Diversity Metrics:** Track the number of men, women, and leavers within the organization.

**Promotion Rates:** Calculate the percentage of employees promoted in a given fiscal year, as well as the percentage of women promoted.

**Hiring Rates:** Track the percentage of male and female hires.

**Turnover Rate:** Measure the percentage of employees who leave the organization.

**Performance Ratings:** Compare the average performance ratings of men and women.

### Extracting Insights:

Analyzing these metrics can provide insights into the company's diversity and inclusion efforts. For example, a low percentage of women promoted or a high turnover rate among women could indicate potential issues with gender balance and inclusion. Similarly, differences in performance ratings between men and women could indicate potential biases in the performance evaluation process.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the tasks provided involved defining proper KPIs for customer retention, creating a dashboard reflecting these KPIs, and discussing insights from diversity and inclusion data.

For customer retention, key KPIs include churn rate, customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, average speed of answer, and agent's performance quadrant. A dashboard was created to visualize these KPIs, allowing for easy monitoring and analysis.

For diversity and inclusion, metrics such as the number of men, women, and leavers, promotion rates, hiring rates, turnover rate, and performance ratings were analyzed. These metrics can provide insights into gender balance, inclusion, and potential biases in the organization.

Overall, the tasks highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in both customer retention and diversity and inclusion efforts. By leveraging data and analytics, organizations can identify areas for improvement and take proactive steps to drive business success.
