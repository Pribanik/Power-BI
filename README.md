## Task 1:

### KPIs to Measure Customer Retention:

**Churn Rate:**
The percentage of customers who stopped using the company's product or service during a specific period.

**Customer Satisfaction:** 
Measured through surveys, feedback, and reviews.

**Calls Answered/Abandoned:** 
The number of calls answered versus the number abandoned.

**Calls by Time:** Distribution of calls over different time periods (e.g., peak hours, off-peak hours).

**Average Speed of Answer:** The average time it takes for calls to be answered.

**Agent's Performance Quadrant:** A comparison of an agent's performance based on the average handle time (talk duration) and calls answered.

### Creating a Dashboard:

The dashboard should include visual representations of these KPIs, such as charts, graphs, and tables, to facilitate easy understanding and decision-making. The dashboard should be customizable, allowing the user to filter data based on different criteria (e.g., time period, agent, customer segment).

## Conclusion

In this analysis of churn rate, customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, average speed of answer, and agent's performance quadrant, several correlations emerge. High churn rates often coincide with low customer satisfaction, potentially stemming from long wait times and high call abandonment rates. There is a negative correlation between the number of calls answered and average speed of answer, suggesting that improving call handling efficiency may lead to more calls being answered. Furthermore, the agent's performance quadrant may reflect these patterns, with agents who handle calls more efficiently likely to have higher performance ratings. This analysis underscores the interconnectedness of these metrics and the importance of optimizing call handling efficiency to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

## Task 2:

### Insights from Diversity and Inclusion Data:

**Diversity Metrics:** Track the number of men, women, and leavers within the organization.

**Promotion Rates:** Calculate the percentage of employees promoted in a given fiscal year, as well as the percentage of women promoted.

**Hiring Rates:** Track the percentage of male and female hires.

**Turnover Rate:** Measure the percentage of employees who leave the organization.

**Performance Ratings:** Compare the average performance ratings of men and women.

### Extracting Insights:

Analyzing these metrics can provide insights into the company's diversity and inclusion efforts. For example, a low percentage of women promoted or a high turnover rate among women could indicate potential issues with gender balance and inclusion. Similarly, differences in performance ratings between men and women could indicate potential biases in the performance evaluation process.

## Conclusion:

In analyzing diversity and inclusion metrics such as the number of men, women, and leavers, promotion rates, hiring rates, turnover rate, and performance ratings, several insights emerge. The data indicates a potential gender imbalance within the organization, with the number of men and women not reflecting a balanced representation. Additionally, the promotion rates for women appear lower than those for men, suggesting potential biases in the promotion process. The hiring rates also indicate a potential gender bias, with men comprising a higher percentage of new hires. The turnover rate, while not directly related to gender, may reflect dissatisfaction or challenges faced by certain groups within the organization. Finally, the performance ratings for men and women may reveal potential biases in performance evaluation, with men and women receiving different ratings despite similar job performance. Overall, the analysis underscores the importance of addressing these disparities to foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace.
